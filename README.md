## Description

The Dual-Layer Intrusion Detection System is a network security tool that provides two layers of defense against cyber threats:

1. **Signature-Based Detection**: This layer focuses on known attack patterns and signatures. It uses a database of predefined attack signatures to identify and block malicious activities.

2. **Anomaly-Based Detection**: In this layer, the system monitors network traffic and user behavior to detect abnormal or suspicious activities that may indicate new, previously unknown threats.

The system combines the strengths of both approaches to provide comprehensive protection for your network infrastructure.

## Features

- Signature-based intrusion detection.
- Anomaly-based intrusion detection.
- Real-time monitoring of network traffic.
- Alerting and reporting mechanisms.
- Customizable rule sets.
- Integration with other security tools.

## Installation

To set up the Dual-Layer Intrusion Detection System, follow these steps:
