# Dual-Layer Intrusion Detection System

A Dual-Layer Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to enhance network security by monitoring and detecting potential threats using anomaly-based techniques.

## Description

The Dual-Layer Intrusion Detection System is a network security tool that provides that combines two different machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of intrusion detection systems,while keeping false alarms to a minimum.
